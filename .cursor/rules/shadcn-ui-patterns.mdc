### Adding New Shadcn Components

The only correct way to add a new `shadcn/ui` component is to run the CLI from within the `packages/ui` directory. This ensures dependencies are added to the correct package and avoids pnpm workspace errors.

**Correct Command:**
```bash
cd packages/ui
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

- Components are installed into `packages/ui/src/components/ui`.
- Component dependencies (e.g., `@radix-ui/react-slot`) are added to `packages/ui/package.json`.

### Using Components

- **From `apps/web`**: Import components directly from the `@codeweaver/ui` package.
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from '@codeweaver/ui/components/ui/button';
  ```
- **Inside `packages/ui`**: Components can use the path alias defined in `apps/web/tsconfig.json`, as this is the primary consuming application.
  ```tsx
  import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
  ```

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

Remember that `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts` is configured to scan `packages/ui` for Tailwind classes. No changes are needed there when adding new components.
