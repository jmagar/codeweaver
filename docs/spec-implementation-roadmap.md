  <strong>Phase 1: Foundation and Core Backend</strong> (5 / 7 tasks completed)
</summary>

**Goal:** Establish the monorepo, core infrastructure, and a functional, type-safe API layer.

- [x] **P1-T1:** Initialize pnpm monorepo and Git repository.
- [x] **P1-T2:** Set up Docker Compose for PostgreSQL & Redis.
- [x] **P1-T3:** Create shared tooling configs (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier).
- [x] **P1-T4:** Scaffold `packages/db` with the core Prisma schema.
- [x] **P1-T5:** Scaffold `packages/api` with an initial tRPC setup.
- [ ] **P1-T6:** Implement User Authentication with NextAuth.js.
- [ ] **P1-T7:** Set up basic CI pipeline in GitHub Actions (Lint, Type-Check, Build).

> **Note:** The core backend and authentication must be functional before significant frontend work can begin.

  <strong>Phase 2: Frontend and Core AI Integration</strong> (2 / 6 tasks completed)
</summary>

**Goal:** Build the main application shell and integrate the first AI provider to enable a basic end-to-end chat experience.

- [x] **P2-T1:** Scaffold `apps/web` with Next.js 15 App Router.
- [x] **P2-T2:** Create the shared UI package (`packages/ui`).
- [ ] **P2-T3:** Build the core UI layout and navigation (Dashboard, Sign-In/Out).
- [ ] **P2-T4:** Implement the AI Provider Abstraction Layer in `packages/lib/ai`.
- [ ] **P2-T5:** Integrate the Vercel AI SDK v5 with the `useChat` hook.
- [ ] **P2-T6:** Connect the chat UI to a tRPC `chat.sendMessage` procedure for end-to-end streaming.

> **Note:** The AI functionality is the core dependency of this phase.

**Goal:** Prepare the application for launch by focusing on performance, security, and deployment automation.

- [ ] **P4-T1:** Implement a multi-layer caching strategy with Redis.
- [ ] **P4-T2:** Harden security (CSP, Rate Limiting, Input Validation).
- [ ] **P4-T3:** Create production-ready Dockerfiles for all applications.
- [ ] **P4-T4:** Enhance the CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- [ ] **P4-T5:** Conduct performance testing and optimization.
- [ ] **P4-T6:** Finalize all documentation and user guides.
- [ ] **P4-T7:** **Initial Production Launch**.

### **Risk Assessment**

| Risk                               | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Provider API Changes**        | The provider abstraction layer is designed to isolate provider-specific logic, simplifying updates.             |
| **Vercel AI SDK v5 is in Beta**    | Stay updated with the SDK's changelog. The modular architecture allows for easier adaptation to breaking changes. |
| **Performance Bottlenecks**        | Early implementation of monitoring (Phase 3) will help identify bottlenecks before they become critical.          |
| **Scope Creep**                    | Adhere strictly to the phased roadmap. New features should be planned for a subsequent version (v1.1).          |
| **Security Vulnerabilities**       | Implement security best practices from the start (Phase 4). Conduct regular dependency and code scans.            |
