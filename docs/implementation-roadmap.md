# Implementation Roadmap for CodeWeaver

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation roadmap for the CodeWeaver project. The roadmap is broken down into four main phases, starting with foundational setup and progressing to advanced features and production hardening. This approach allows for iterative development, early feedback, and a clear path to launch.

## 2. Phase 1: Foundation and Core Backend (Weeks 1-3)

**Goal:** Establish the monorepo, core infrastructure, and a functional, type-safe API layer.

| Task ID | Description                                     | Deliverables                                                              | Status      |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| P1-T1   | Initialize pnpm monorepo and Git repository     | Project structure, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`    | To Do       |
| P1-T2   | Set up Docker Compose for PostgreSQL & Redis    | `docker-compose.yml`, running local infrastructure                        | To Do       |
| P1-T3   | Create shared tooling configs (TS, ESLint)      | `tooling/` directory with base configurations                             | To Do       |
| P1-T4   | Scaffold `packages/db` with Prisma schema       | Prisma schema for User, Auth, and Conversation models; generated client   | To Do       |
| P1-T5   | Scaffold `packages/api` with tRPC               | Initial tRPC router, context setup, basic health check procedure          | To Do       |

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk                               | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Provider API Changes**        | The provider abstraction layer is designed to isolate provider-specific logic, simplifying updates.             |
| **Vercel AI SDK v5 is in Beta**    | Stay updated with the SDK's changelog. The modular architecture allows for easier adaptation to breaking changes. |
| **Performance Bottlenecks**        | Early implementation of monitoring (Phase 3) will help identify bottlenecks before they become critical.          |
| **Scope Creep**                    | Adhere strictly to the phased roadmap. New features should be planned for a subsequent version (v1.1).          |
| **Security Vulnerabilities**       | Implement security best practices from the start (Phase 4). Conduct regular dependency and code scans.            |

This roadmap provides a clear path forward but should be treated as a living document, subject to adjustments based on development progress and emerging priorities.
